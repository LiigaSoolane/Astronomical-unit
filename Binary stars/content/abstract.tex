SW Lac is a well observed short-period contact binary system. The first photoelectric 
UBV light curves of the system collected highlighted the light curve asymmetries from 
cycle to cycle. These asymmetries were confirmed and assigned to the existence of cool 
spot regions. The data collected of the object SW Lac was in B, V and R bands with a total 
of 2,275 images taken at $3, 1.5, 0.7$ second exposure times in the BVR filters respectively.
 Magnitude differences were calculated between the two comparison stars and the object, 
 and between the two comparison stars. Plots of the difference in magnitude verses julian
