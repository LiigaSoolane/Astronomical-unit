\label{sec:obs}

The first images collected were twenty four Bias images. They were collected by setting the 
exposure time to zero while the shutter is closed. Then the seven dark images were taken at 
300 second exposure times with the camera shutter closed. The data collected of the object 
SW Lac was in B, V and R bands with a total of $2,275$ images taken at $3, 1.5, 0.7$ second 
exposure times in the BVR filters respectively. Nine flat field images were taken in each 
filter for 3 second exposure times. The images were collected at the $0.5$ meter Lutz telescope
 at Northern Arizona University on 11 05 2021 (UT). The Apogee instruments U47 CCD camera 
 ($1024$ x $1024$ pixels) was used with a plate scale of $0.65$ arcsec/pixel with a field of view 
 of $11.1$ arcmin x $ 11.1$ arcmin.
